Simple and easy travel expenses managing app. This app provides you with the features that allows you to easily manage your travel expenses. Add a location and expenses along with description, date, price, and note. 

## Overview

Worked to teach myself fullstack development by creating this web application. Used React for client side, Redux to store the global states, and Node.js and Firebase for database persistence. 

This project is deployed by Heroku and you can check the live website from [here](https://travex-app.herokuapp.com).
Try out guest mode! You can also log in with your google account powered by google authentication service provided by firebase.
